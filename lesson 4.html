                    <h2>Lesson 4:What is an Operating System?</h2>
                    <p>The operating system is the most
                        important program that runs on a computer. Every
                        general-purpose computer must have an operating
                        system to run other programs. Operating systems
                        perform basic tasks, such as recognizing input from
                        the keyboard, sending output to the display screen,
                        keeping track of files and directories on the disk,
                        and controlling peripheral devices such as disk
                        drives and printers.
                        For large systems, the operating system has
                        even greater responsibilities and powers. It is like a
                        traffic cop -- it makes sure that different program and users running at the same time
                        do not interfere with each other. The operating system is also responsible
                        for security, ensuring that unauthorized users do not access the system.</p>
                <br>
                <h5>Importance of Operating System</h5>
				<div class="pra">
					<p>An operating system is the most important software that runs on a computer. It manages the computer's memory and processes, as well as all of its software and hardware. It also allows you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer's language.</p>
                    
                    <h5>Can You Use A Computer Without An Operating System?</h5>
                    <div class="pra">
                        <p>Nowadays, if you buy a new computing machine, it is likely that preloaded programs are already inside it. You can play some of the preinstalled games, play audio and video files, and even make a document without installing additional software. Computers nowadays can work out of the box, which has been mainly because of operating systems. But have you ever wondered how people use computers without them before?
                            <br> You can use a computer without an OS, but it’s more likely that you can’t run your favorite programs. Most programs nowadays are written and developed to run inside an operating system. If you want to use a PC without an OS, you need to write a functional program using machine code.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Operating systems can be classified as follows:</h5>

                                   Operating systems provide a software platform on which
                                    other application programs can run. The application programs must be written to run
                                    on top of a particular operating system. Your choice of operating system, therefore,
                                    determines to a great extent the applications you can run. For PCs, the most popular
                                    operating systems are DOS, OS/2, and Windows, but others are available, such
                                    as Linux
