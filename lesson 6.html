                    <h2>Lesson 6: What are the input and output devices of a computer?</h2>
                    <p>The devices attached to a personal computer can be classified into two- the
                      input and output devices. INPUT DEVICE is composed of a device that accepts data
                      and instructions from the user or from another computer system. While, OUTPUT
                      DEVICE is any piece of computer hardware that displays results after the computer
                      has processed the input data that has been entered</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h5>INPUT DEVICES</h5> 
                <p>An input device is essentially a piece of hardware that sends data to a computer. Most input devices either interact with or control the computer in some way. The most common input devices are the mouse and the keyboard, but there are many others.
                Below are the examples of Input Devices
                </p>

                      <img src="img\Keyboard.png" alt="Keyboard" width="600" height="400">
                    </a>
                    <h5>Keyboard</h5>
                    <div class="desc">Keyboards are the most common type of input device. Before keyboards, interaction with computers was generally carried out using punch cards and paper tape.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Most English language keyboards use the QWERTY layout for the alphabetic keys, which are surrounded by number, symbol, function, and other key types. By pressing the relevant keys, a user can feed data and instructions to the computer.

                  </div>
                  
                  <div class="gallery">
                    <a target="_blank" href="img\Mouse.png">
                      <img src="img\Mouse.png" alt="Mouse" width="600" height="400">
                    </a>
                    <h5>Mouse</h5>
                    <div class="desc">A mouse interacts with a computer through a process known as "point and click." Essentially, when a user moves the mouse on the mouse pad, the pointer moves in a corresponding direction on the computer's monitor screen.
                      <br>
                      <br>
              
                      The concept of a computer mouse has its roots in the trackball, a related pointing device invented in 1946 that used a "roller ball" to control a pointer. Most modern computer mice have two buttons for clicking and a wheel in the middle for scrolling up and down documents and web pages.</div>

                    </a>
                    <h5>Touchpad</h5>
                    <div class="desc">Also known as a trackpad, a touchpad is a common substitute for a computer mouse. It is essentially a specialized surface that can detect the movement of a user's finger and use that information to direct a pointer and control a computer.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Touchpads were first introduced for laptops in the 1990s, and it's now rare to find a laptop without one.</div>

                    <h5>Scanner</h5>
                    <div class="desc">The word "scanner" can be used in a number of different ways in the computer world, but here I am using it to refer to a desktop image scanner.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Essentially, a scanner is an input device that uses optical technology to transfer images (or sometimes text) into a computer, where the signal is converted into a digital image. The digital image can then be viewed on a monitor screen, saved, edited, emailed, or printed.

                    <h5>Microphone</h5>
                    <div class="desc"> A microphone captures audio and sends it to a computer where it is converted to a digital format. Once the audio has been digitized, it can be played back, copied, edited, uploaded, or emailed. Microphones can also be used to record audio or to relay sounds live as part of a video chat or audio stream.

                    </a>
                    <h5>Joystick</h5>
                    <div class="desc">Joysticks are commonly used to control characters and vehicles in computer video games. Essentially, a joystick is a handle that pivots on a base and sends its angle or direction to the computer as data. Many video gaming joysticks feature triggers and buttons that can be pressed to use weapons or projectiles in games.</div>

                    </a>
                    <h5>Web Cam</h5>
                    <div class="desc">Webcams are different from digital cameras in two ways. Firstly, they cannot operate independently from a computer, and second, they have no inbuilt memory.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Although webcams can capture photographs and videos, they are more often used to live-stream videos or facilitate video chats, for this reason. webcam devices often incorporate built-in microphones in addition to cameras.</div>
