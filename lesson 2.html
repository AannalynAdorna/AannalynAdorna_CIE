                    <h2>Lesson 2: Classification of Computer</h2>
                    <p>The following are the classification of the different types of computers based
                        on their sizes and functionalities:</p>
            
                <img src="img\classification of pc.png">
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h5>Mainframe Computers:</h5>
				<div class="pra">
					<p>Large organizations use mainframes for highly critical
                        applications such as bulk data processing and ERP. Most of the mainframe
                        computers have the capacities to host multiple operating systems and operate as a
                        number of virtual machines and can substitute for several small servers.</p>
                <br>
				<h5> Servers:</h5>
				<div class="pra">
					<p>They are computers designed to provide services to client machines in a
                        computer network. They have larger storage capacities and powerful processors.
                        Running on them are programs that serve client requests and allocate resources like
                        memory and time to client machines. Usually they are very large in size, as they
                        have large processors and many hard drives.</p>
			<br>
				<h5>Supercomputers:</h5>
				<div class="pra">
					<p>The highly calculation-intensive tasks can be effectively
                        performed by means of supercomputers. Quantum physics, mechanics, weather
                        forecasting, molecular theory are best studied by means of supercomputers. Their
                        ability of parallel processing and their well-designed memory hierarchy give the
                        supercomputers, large transaction processing powers.</p>
                <br>
                    <h5>Minicomputers:</h5>
                    <div class="pra">
                        <p>In terms of size and processing capacity, minicomputers lie in
                            between mainframes and microcomputers. Minicomputers are also called mid-range systems or workstations. The term began to be popularly used in the 1960s to refer
                            to relatively smaller third generation computers.</p>
                    
                    <h5>Microcomputer:</h5>
                            <div class="pra">
                                <p>A computer with a microprocessor and its central processing unit
                                    it is known as a microcomputer. They do not occupy space as much as mainframes
                                    do. When supplemented with a keyboard and a mouse, microcomputers can be
                                    called personal computers. A monitor, a keyboard and other similar input output
                                    devices, computer memory in the form of RAM and a power supply unit come
                                    packaged in a microcomputer. These computers can fit on desks or tables and prove
                                    to be the best choice for single-user tasks.
