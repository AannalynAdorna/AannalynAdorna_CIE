                    <h2>Lesson 5:  What are the devices of a computer?</h2>
                    <p>The physical, touchable, electronic and mechanical parts of a computer are
                        called the hardware which is composed of different devices attached to the
                        computer. <br>
                        The following list represents a basic set of devices found in most Personal
                        Computers</p>
                <br>

                    <h5>System Unit</h5>
                    <div class="desc">The main part of a microcomputer, sometimes called the chassis. It
                        includes the following parts: Motherboard, Microprocessor, Memory Chips, Buses,
                        Ports, Expansion Slots and Cards
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A system unit is the part of a computer that houses the primary devices that perform operations and produce results for complex calculations. It includes the motherboard, CPU, RAM and other components, as well as the case in which these devices are housed. This unit performs the majority of the functions that a computer is required to do.
<br>
<br>
The term system unit is generally used to differentiate between the computer itself and its peripheral devices, such as the keyboard, mouse and monitor.

                    <h5>Motherboard</h5>
                    <div class="desc">Alternatively referred to as the mb, mainboard, mboard, mobo, mobd, backplane board, base board, main circuit board, planar board, system board, or a logic board on Apple computers. The motherboard is a printed circuit board and foundation of a computer that 
                        is the biggest board in a computer chassis. It allocates power and allows communication to and between the CPU, RAM, and all other computer hardware components.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A motherboard provides connectivity between the hardware components of a computer, like the processor (CPU), memory (RAM), hard drive, and video card. There are multiple types of motherboards, designed to fit different types and sizes of computers.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Each type of motherboard is designed to work with specific types of processors and memory, so they don't work with every processor and type of memory. However, hard drives are mostly universal and work with the majority of motherboards, regardless of the type or brand.

                    <h5>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</h5>
                    <div class="desc">The CPU is the brain of a computer, containing all the circuitry needed to process input, store data, and output results.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The CPU is constantly following instructions of computer programs that tell it which data to process and how to process it. Without a CPU, we could not run programs on a computer.</div>

                    <h5>Primary Storage</h5>
                    <div class="desc">- (internal storage, main memory or memory) is the computer's
                        working storage space that holds data, instructions for processing and processed
                        data (information) waiting to be sent to secondary storage. Physically, primary
                        storage is a collection of RAM chips.
                        </div>

                    <br>
                    <h5>Random Access Memory (RAM)</h5>
                    <div class="desc">RAM is used in computers to temporarily store files in use on the computer.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        RAM chips often range in storage capacity from 1 to 256 GB.RAM is volatile, requiring power to store data.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        RAM is available in two primary sizes, whether used in a desktop computer or a laptop. Desktop RAM is about 5 Â½ inches in length and 1 inch in width. Laptop RAM is about half the length of desktop RAM.

                        <div class="desc">ROM is non-volatile, meaning it holds data even
                          when the power is ON or OFF</div>

                    <h5>Expansion Bus</h5>
                    <div class="desc"> A bus is a data pathway between
                      several hardware components inside or outside a
                      computer. It does not only connect the parts of the CPU to
                      each other, but also links the CPU with other important
                      hardware.
