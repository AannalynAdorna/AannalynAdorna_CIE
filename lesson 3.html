                    <h2>Lesson 3: Types of Personal Computer</h2>
                    <p>Personal computers come in different forms such as desktops, laptops and
                        personal digital assistants (refer to Figure 3). Let us look at each of these types of
                        computers.</p>
                <br>
                <img src="img\types of comp.png">
                <br>
                <br>
                <h5>Desktops:</h5>
				<div class="pra">
					<p>A desktop is intended to be used on a single location. The spare parts of
                        a desktop computer are readily available at relatively lower costs. Power
                        consumption is not as critical as that in laptops. Desktops are widely popular for daily
                        use in the workplace and households.</p>
                <br>
				<h5> Laptops:</h5>
				<div class="pra">
					<p>Similar in operation to desktops, laptop computers are miniaturized and
                        optimized for mobile use. Laptops run on a single battery or an external adapter that
                        charges the computer batteries.</p>
                <br>
                 <h5>Netbooks:</h5>
                        <div class="pra">
                            <p>They fall in the category of laptops, but are inexpensive and relatively
                                smaller in size. They had a smaller feature set and lesser capacities in comparison
                                to regular laptops, at the time they came into the market.</p>
			<br>
				<h5>Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs):</h5>
				<div class="pra">
					<p>It is a handheld computer and popularly
                        known as a palmtop. It has a touch screen and a memory card for storage of data.
                        PDAs can also be used as portable audio players, web browsers and smart phones.
                        Most of them can access the Internet by means of Bluetooth or Wi-Fi
                        communication.</p>
                <br>
                    <h5>Tablet Computer</h5>
                    <div class="pra">
                        <p>Tablets are mobile computers that are very handy to use. They
                            use the touch screen technology. Tablets come with an onscreen keyboard or use a
                            stylus or a digital pen. Apple's iPod redefined the class of tablet computers.</p>

                            <h5>Wearable Computers:</h5>
                            <div class="pra">
                                <p>: A record-setting step in the evolution of computers was the
                                    creation of wearable computers. These computers can be worn on the body and are
                                    often used in the study of behavior modeling and human health. Military and health
                                    professionals have incorporated wearable computers into their daily routine, as a
                                    part of such studies. When the users' hands and sensory organs are engaged in
                                    other activities, wearable computers are of great help in tracking human actions.
                                    Wearable computers do not have to be turned on and off and remain in operation
                                    without user intervention.</p>
